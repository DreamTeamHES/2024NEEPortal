# About this project

The project, titled **"NRE_Portal: Production Potential of New Renewable Energies (NRE)"**, aims to support Switzerland's **Energy Strategy 2050**, which focuses on increasing the production of renewable and distributed energy sources. The goal is to create a platform that provides **real-time data** on energy production from new renewable sources and showcases the **production potential** for the canton of Valais.

## Key aspects of the project include:
- Developing a platform that visualizes current NRE power plants and allows the registration of new ones.
- Analyzing the region's renewable energy production potential and visualizing:
  - Peak and off-peak periods.
  - Challenges of integrating this energy into the grid.
  - The need for storage solutions.

The project will be managed using **agile software development methodologies** and will utilize the existing **TFS infrastructure** for software industrialization.
